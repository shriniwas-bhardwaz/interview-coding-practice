Features Required:

1. Board Initialization: A board with a predefined size.
2. Players: Multiple players can play the game.
3. Snakes and Ladders: Random placement of snakes and ladders.
4. Dice Roll: A player can roll a dice and move accordingly.
5. Game Logic: Movement according to dice roll and handling snakes and ladders.

Design Patterns Involved:

Singleton Pattern: Used for creating a single instance of the board to ensure that all players interact with the same board.
Factory Pattern: Used to create snakes and ladders on the board.
Observer Pattern: Used to notify players about their turns.
Strategy Pattern: Used to define the dice rolling strategy, which can be changed dynamically.

In the entire game we are moving that is changing the player position.
So as to encapsulate this move as an object we are going to use command pattern.
Command Pattern: Used to encapsulate a request as an object to parameterize clients with queues, requests, and operations.
